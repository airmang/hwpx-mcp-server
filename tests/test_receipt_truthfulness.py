"""The completion-truth invariant: a tool may not report work it did not do.

The invariant
=============

    ok is true AND the request asked for a nonzero amount of work
        implies
    the file's sha256 changed, OR a typed partial failure is reported.

The antecedent counts what was *requested*, never what was *produced*. Counting
production makes the invariant vacuous: a run that reports ``ok`` with zero
fills would satisfy "produced == 0 implies nothing", which is exactly the shape
of the defect this file exists to prevent.

What went wrong
===============

``apply_evalplan_fill`` captured its receipt from the structural step and then
ran six content-fill steps that kept mutating the bytes without touching it.
The publish decision in ``ops_services.form_fields`` reads ``byteIdentical``
from that receipt, so an in-place call reported ``ok`` together with a content
report listing twenty-six filled regions, and wrote nothing at all. The file's
sha256 was identical before and after.

That is the same class of failure the project already names elsewhere -- a
machine score read as a submission -- except here the score was not merely
optimistic, it was false.
