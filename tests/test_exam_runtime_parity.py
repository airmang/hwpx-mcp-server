"""Parity between the MCP exam owner and core's frozen 4.x exam shape.

``hwpx.exam`` (and its ``ir``/``parser``/``profile``/``measure``/``compose``
submodules) is scheduled for physical deletion from core once python-hwpx is
reduced to a library, so this file no longer imports it. Instead:

- Structural claims (exports, signatures, and all ten dataclasses' field
  shapes — ``Placeholder``/``Question``/``QuestionSet``/``ExamDoc``,
  ``ResolvedStyle``/``FormProfile``, ``SplitReport``,
  ``ParaSpec``/``ComposePlan``/``ComposeResult``) compare the live MCP
  module's ``tests.parity_fingerprint.fingerprint()`` against
  ``tests/parity_fingerprints/exam.json``, frozen from core while it still
  existed. Not covered: each dataclass's ``__dataclass_params__`` (e.g.
  ``frozen=True``/``slots=True``) — ``fingerprint()`` captures field
  name/type/has-default, not the dataclass decorator's own flags.
- Behavioural claims that need an actual computed value (markdown parsing,
  the parse-error shape, the geometry helpers, ``profile_form``, and
  ``compose_exam_into_form``'s result + output bytes) compare against
  ``tests/parity_fingerprints/exam.golden.json`` — values captured from that
  same frozen core commit and confirmed identical to MCP's own output at
  freeze time. The composed output's full zip bytes were not embedded
  (uncompressed, it is >1 MB of duplicate form imagery) — its per-entry
  SHA-256 hashes are, which still catches a byte-level regression.

``hwpx.oxml.document``, ``hwpx.document`` and ``hwpx.tools.package_validator``
are not being deleted and stay imported live, unchanged from before.
``WordBox`` comes from the automation owner: core keeps the neutral fit contract —
policy, measure, engine, report, apply — but ``form_fit.wordbox`` is the
application half, since reading a PDF needs an imaging stack. ``hwpx.visual.oracle`` *is* scheduled for
deletion, but this file only ever used its ``NullOracle`` as an inert
constructor argument — the automation owner's own ``NullOracle`` fills that role
just as well, so this file does not need visual.oracle frozen at all.

Every assertion the pre-freeze version of this file made is still made here;
none needed dropping. The fixtures (``A_form.hwpx``, ``sample_exam.md``) are
read from the core repository, which is resolved without importing the removed
package — see
that directory's ``NOTICE.md`` for provenance — because the original path
derivation via ``Path(core_ir.__file__)`` no longer works without importing
core's ``hwpx.exam.ir``.
